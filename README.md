# WordPress Pet Shop Theme
A fully custom WordPress theme showcasing flexibility and advanced customization, built from scratch to create a mock pet shop with WooCommerce integration and a custom post type for pet adoption.

## Project Overview
As a primarily React and Node.js developer, I wanted to expand my skill set by diving into WordPress development. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge by creating a custom WordPress theme. The theme powers a mock pet shop website, with WooCommerce for e-commerce functionality and a custom post type for pet adoption, demonstrating WordPressâ€™s versatility.

The theme is built using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, focusing on WordPress-specific PHP functions. I also incorporated GLSL shaders to create dynamic visuals and an interactive touch in the user interface, adding a creative layer to the project.

Note: This project is a mock pet shop and not a fully functional e-commerce site.
